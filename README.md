This code aims to achieve a standard particle packing generation framework for granular materials. This code not only allows users to generate a series of random packings that fulfill their requirements (such as particle size distribution, porosity, and stress) but also provides a series of tools for particle packing characterization of internally or externally generated packings.

## Main Features

This program deals with the classical **soft-sphere approach** of the DEM.
The main characteristics of this method are:

- It is assumed that the contact between the particles occurs through a small overlap between them.
- Each contact is evaluated through several time steps in an explicit integration scheme.
- Contact models relate the amount of overlap between neighboring particles to the forces between them.
- Other physical interactions (e.g. thermal) may also be related to the overlap between particles.
- The shape of the particles is kept unchanged during and after contact. 

## DEMGen Dependencies

DEMGen is fully written in the Pythonpython_website programming language and adopts the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm to offer modularity and extensibility.

Please make sure you have installed Python3.X.X on your PC. Currently, [Python3.10.0][python310_website] is recommended, as other versions haven't been tested.

For the dynamic generation methods, DEM calculations are required. The [DEM Application][demapp_link] of the [Kratos Multiphysics][kratos_link] framework is adopted here. By including the [external_libraries][web] to your 

## Instructions

### Input and Output Files

There are three types of files that may be used as input for the program:

* **Parameters (_.json_)**: 

This [JSON][json_link] file is necessary for running a simulation and must always be

* **Results (_.txt_)**: 

This binary file stores the results of a simulation.

### Running Simulations

To run a simulation, launch MATLAB and execute the script file [*main.m*][main_file_link] located inside the folder [*src*][src_folder_link].

#### Packing Generation

steps

#### Packing Characterization

### Checking Results

To load and show the results from previously run simulations, launch MATLAB and execute the script file [*main.m*][main_file_link] located inside the folder [*src*][src_folder_link].

## Examples

Sample models are available inside the folder [*examples*][examples_link].

They are separated into different sub-folders according to their analysis type,
and each example has its _Project_ _Parameters_ and _Model_ _Parts_ files, as well as some results in the output sub-folders.
